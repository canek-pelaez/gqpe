Gtk+ Quick Photo Editor
=======================

Gtk+ Quick Photo Editor (GQPE for short; pronounced yee-kee-pee-yay,
because reasons) is a small image tag editor. It's a companion
program for Gallery 3 Uploader[1].

Since I only need to set the Iptc.Application2.Caption and the
Exif.Image.Orientation tags, this program is intended to set those
tags as fast as possible. The program shows the picture, and allows
the user to rotate it and to enter the Iptc.Application2.Caption
tag.

While it can be used with the mouse, that's not the way is intended
to be used: all the available manipulations are possible using only
the keyboard:

* [ and ] will rotate the picture to the left and right,
  respectively.
* Enter in the text entry (if not empty) will update the relevant
  tags in the picture and move to the next one. You need to do this
  (or click on the save button) to update the tags in the picture,
  otherwise all the changes are ignored.
* Page Up and Page Down will move to the next or the previous
  picture, respectively, without updating the current one.
* Esc will terminate the program.

The idea is to select a bunch of pictures in Nautilus, open them
with this program, and quickly update their information.

The Xmp.dc.subject tag is not handled by this program, since that is
actually something that can be done quickly enough with the command
line.

With the Xmp.dc.subject and Iptc.Application2.Caption correctly set,
you can call g3uploader to send the pictures tu a Gallery3
installation, or/and import them in Shotwell[1], which also uses the
Iptc.Application2.Caption as title, and Xmp.dc.subject as tag
(inside Shotwell).


Requirements
------------

You need the following to compile GQPE:

* Gtk+-3
* gexiv2

The program is written in Vala, but you only need Vala if you don't
use tarballs.
