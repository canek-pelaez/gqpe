Gtk+ Quick Photo Editor
=======================

Gtk+ Quick Photo Editor (GQPE for short) is a small image tag
editor.

GQPE only cares for the Xmp.dc.subject, Iptc.Application2.Caption,
Exif.Image.ImageDescription and the Exif.Image.Orientation tags, so this program
is intended to set those tags as fast as possible. The program shows the
picture, and allows the user to rotate it and to enter the Xmp.dc.subject,
Iptc.Application2.Caption, and Exif.Image.ImageDescription tags.

While it can be used with the mouse, that's not the way is intended
to be used: All the available manipulations are possible using only
the keyboard:

* [ and ] will rotate the picture to the left and right, respectively.

* Enter in any text entry (if not empty) or Control-Enter will update the
  relevant tags in the picture and move to the next one. You need to do this (or
  click on the save button) to update the tags in the picture, otherwise all the
  changes are ignored.

* Page Up and Page Down will move to the next or the previous picture,
  respectively, without updating the current one.

* Esc will terminate the program.

The idea is to select a bunch of pictures in Nautilus, open them with this
program, and quickly update their information.

With the Xmp.dc.subject and Iptc.Application2.Caption correctly set, you can
import them in Shotwell[1], which also uses the Iptc.Application2.Caption as
title, and Xmp.dc.subject as tag (inside Shotwell).


Requirements
------------

You need the following to compile GQPE:

* Gtk+-3
* libgee-0.8
* gexiv2

The program is written in Vala, but you only need Vala if you don't use
tarballs.
